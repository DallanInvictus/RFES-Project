CK3 Mod:
	- All volumes for mood music reduced so that their most common peaks are at -18.0 dB. Usually, this means normalizing to -18.0 dB, but sometimes the track has a few big peaks, so normalizing to -15.0 dB achieves this effect for those. This is roughly the volume of the loudest parts of vanilla CK3's mood tracks.
	Mosaic, Sandstorm, Supplication:
		- Applied a High-Pass Filter at 500 Hz with a 6 dB octave falloff.
	Tabasum:
		- Applied a High-Pass Filter at 500 Hz with a 6 dB octave falloff.
		- Added ca. 5 seconds of reverb-powered fade-out to the end, because the track ends 9 seconds before it's actually supposed to.
		- Reduced track tempo by 5%.
	Hymns of Saint Leonides, Veni Creator Spiritus, Psalm 33, Oh Lord as Thou camest to Thy Passion:
		- Added a Pseudo-Stereo effect (the tracks were recorded in mono, but redistributed in stereo).
