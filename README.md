## Copyright, Licensing, & Other Legal Stuff

Special care is taken to make sure that all audio included in the project is royalty-free for sharing/redistribution. This should mean that playing with the mods that are part of this project should result in no takedown requests, copyright strikes, or similar licensing disputes on services like YouTube and Twitch. If you do end up encountering such things merely from gameplay footage playing music from this mod, please let me know as soon as possible, preferably through the Issues page, so that I may remove the mislicensed file from the project to prevent further harm.

However, if you wish to incorporate parts of this project in a commercial endeavor, a non-open-source project, or in a derivative work, please note that some of the audio found in this project imposes restrictions on these activities. For full information about each audio file's license, please consult the `LICENSE` file found in the same folder where the given audio file is located.

If you are the author of any of the files included in this project and believe that your work is not appropriately licensed for it, please let me know as soon as possible, preferably through the Issues page, so that I may remove the mislicensed file from the project to prevent further harm. Note that all `LICENSE` files not only contain each audio file's license, but also the location from where it was sourced, so you should also check the source of any mislicensed tracks and request takedowns there, too.

## Submitting Requests/Contributions

If you wish to submit a request to include a particular piece of audio in this project, you may do so through a Pull Request to this repository. In order to not waste everyone's time, check the following to make sure that your request fits in with this project:

1. **Is the audio explicitly licensed for royalty-free redistribution?** This project is specifically aimed at making sure all included tracks are appropriately licensed and royalty-free.
	- Any audio that is not explicitly marked as such is not licensed for royalty-free redistribution. If you do not have a master license to your submission, you cannot assume that a work is licensed for royalty-free redistribution unless it is explicitly marked as such. Even if your submission is your own work, you may not actually have a master license to specific recordings of your work; it all depends on agreements that you may have signed with publishers, studios, and other third parties.
	- Public domain works and works licensed under some kind of Creative Commons license do pass this step, but be careful: some people illegally re-upload content that is not royalty-free to various websites and mark them as Creative Commons and/or public domain, so be sure that you have gotten the license for your audio 100% correct.
	- **If a track does not make note of any licensing information, then it is by default NOT royalty-free. No, Fair Use does not cover any mods in this project.** I cannot stress this enough, because people on the internet have all kinds of strange ideas about how copyright laws work: take licensing seriously, at least when it comes to this project.
2. **Is the audio of an appropriate sound quality?** People generally do not want to listen to poor-quality audio.
	- Any audio tracks that you submit should have an average bitrate of at least 128 kbps and a sample rate of at least 44.1 kHz; audio with at least two channels is preferable, though I will not refuse a mono track that still sounds good and passes all other requirements. Anything less than that tends to be very noticeably of poor sound quality even on cheap audio equipment. Higher bitrates are always better (lossless formats like FLAC and WAV being the best, though the mods' reliance on Ogg Vorbis means that bitrates above roughly 500 kbps will make little difference), but make sure your submissions average at least 128 kbps.
	- Make sure that your audio is either a studio recording (i.e. not a field, radio, or live recording) or one where the fact that it is not a studio recording is barely noticeable, if at all. Noises such as coughing, sneezing, audience cheering, audience laughter, noticeably echo-y acoustics, DJ voiceovers, etc. that are present in the audio in such a way that makes them impossible to remove without affecting the track itself will disqualify submissions.
3. **Is the audio of an appropriate style?** The Crusader Kings games are set in ca. the late 700s to the late 1400s in Eurasia sans the Far East, plus North Africa and parts of Subsaharan West and Central Africa. Audio in this project should abide by that setting.
	- In general, audio made with digital or electronic instruments is not appropriate for this project, as is audio made with instruments invented after this timeframe (e.g. pianos, accordions) and musical styles developed after this timeframe (e.g. Afrobeat, most Roma-influenced European styles, Polka, the vast majority of Klezmer styles).
		- When submitting audio intended for Crusader Kings 2's Sunset Invasion DLC, make sure that whatever you are submitting is specifically from Northern Mesoamerica. American Indian music from outside this region is not appropriate for Sunset Invasion.
	- Music for this project should not only sound authentic, but be authentic as well. **This also includes almost all modern-day "cinematic" music: merely sounding authentic to the untrained ear is not good enough.**
	- Since the audio will be meant for inclusion in the Crusader Kings game series, it must fit stylistically with those games' existing soundscape. In the case of music, this generally means that there should be at least two performers with at least three different instruments (voice counts as an instrument), and that any vocals should all be in a language appropriate for the piece in Crusader Kings' context (e.g. no French vocals in African songs, no English vocals in Irish songs).

Once you have made sure that you submission has passed all of these prerequisites, you can get to actually making your submission. To do so, clone this repository, add your file to the appropriate folder in the `Raw Audio` directory, write down all appropriate licensing and sourcing information in the`LICENSE` file that is in the same place where you added your audio file, commit and push your changes to your cloned repository, and submit a pull request to this repository. I will then review your submission and decide if it should be included in the project. **Making a submission is no guarantee that your submission is accepted, even if you think it passes all the requirements.** If it is included though, I will handle all of the volume normalization, post-processing, mod file updating, and other work needed to actually include the file in the appropriate mod(s).
